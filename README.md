# Rumor Detection using Python

## Overview
This repository contains source code for the Wolbachia Rumor Detection project, aimed at detecting rumors related to Wolbachia on Twitter. Wolbachia is a genus of bacteria that infects arthropod species and is being researched for its potential use in controlling mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Zika virus.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project has been collected by our team from Twitter. It includes tweets related to Wolbachia based on Indonesian Language, categorized as either rumors or non-rumors. The dataset has been preprocessed and annotated for training and evaluation of the rumor detection model.

## Model
The rumor detection model implemented in this project is based on machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It utilizes various features extracted from the text of tweets, such as word embeddings, sentiment analysis, and linguistic features, to classify tweets as rumors or non-rumors.
